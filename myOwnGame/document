reading chapter 16 is a real bitch, try figure it out on your own first

for the graphics module, 
    create a utility function to create elements, attributes(let the argument be an object) and children
        note just like b4 examples, the elt function does not append to the dom for you still have to "document.appendChild(elt("p", ...))" or whatever

    so the background should only be drawn once, actors are the only things that should change

    have a constant for scaling the entire display of the game, this JS const can change the style tag at the top of the 
    document

    can draw the background as a table??

    so for each new state, remove the old actors and add actors for curretn state.

    the game has a scrolling background
