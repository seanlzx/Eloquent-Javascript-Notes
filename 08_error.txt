"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as 
cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."

-Brian Kernighan and P.J. Plauger, The Elements of Programming Style

essentailly two kinds of bugs
-those caused by ideas being confused
-those caused while ideas were converted to code

best to enable strict mode
	"user strict";
	
Note: outside of strict mode, when you declare a variable without any prefix, Javascript will quietly create a global binding 

strict mode also does
	disallow giving a function multiple parameters with the same name
	removes with statements (which is so wrong it is not further discussed in this book - Marijin Haverbeke
	
Great tip
	instead of making overly long binding names
	let rawtuplelistjoindictwhateverfuckshitcunt
	
	just use comments
	# this is the thing that you get from the sql select whatever convert to dictionary
	categories_dict
	
TypeScript is a JS dialect

Testing
	testing manually is a bad idea
	
	automated testing is worth it

not all problems can be prevented by the programmer, is say your program communicates with the outside world
