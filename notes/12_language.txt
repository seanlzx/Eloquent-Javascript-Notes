"The evaluator, which determines the meaning of expressions in a programming language, is just another program."

-Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

egg
    The most visible part of a programming language is its syntax or notation. A parser reads the text and produces a data 
    structure that reflects the structure of the program.

    everything in egg is an expression
        bindings
        numbers
        strings
        applications
            will be for our function calls and also for constructs like if or while

    to keep things simple we wont support string escapes

    application notation for egg, will be as seen here
